I'm still trying to figure out a way to properly categorize and treat how I cover information covered on this site. Similar sites tend to have some categorization applied before hand either through the challenge types or an overal generalized themed that neatly handles that. I think for a first pass I'll establish a split between challenge and walkthrough rooms, and then categorize based on that.
