# Summary
<For once this is completed>

# Task 1: Introduction
Like most of the introductions of walkthroughs, it covers a summary of what the room is about and it's learning objectives.

# Task 2: Web Application Overview
 This section goes a high level introduction of some of the terminology used to define aspects of what makes up web applications. While not fully inclusive of every technology at this point, it just lays out some fundamental examples.

 Front End:
 This is elements we see when interacting with a web application in the browser, basic contents like HTML; CSS for the formatting and look (style); and JavaScript for more interactions and features.

 Back End:
 These are the components that make up of things we don't see in the browser such as the database, the infrastructure that supports it, and security elements like Web Application Firewalls.

 Databases are integral to multiple aspects of a web application, either keeping track sessions, login credentials, purchases, inventory. If it needs to be stored, databases are the go to solution. For attackers looking to sell PII or do major damage to an organizations reputation, these are by far one of the most prized targets.
